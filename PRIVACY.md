## 🔐 What We Collect
We do **not** collect any personal information. We do not use trackers, analytics, or advertising.

## ✅ What We Store
- **Access tokens** are temporarily stored via `chrome.storage.sync` (encrypted, browser-managed)
- **Offline logs** are saved only in your browser’s `localStorage` until synced

These are not shared with anyone, and no data is ever transmitted unless initiated by the user.

## 🔄 Authentication
- Jira login is handled through Atlassian's official OAuth2 service
- We use Chrome's Identity API to facilitate a secure login experience
- Tokens are exchanged securely via HTTPS through our backend

Our backend **never stores credentials**, and **never logs or persists token data**.
